This allows you to use dynamic URLs in Button URL actions.

Simply add the code from customButtonURLs.js to the JavaScript in a custom code block. No changes to the code are needed.

You can now use values from the metadata in your URLs by surrounding them in a ${} block.

Example URL: https://www.example.com/user=${visitor.id}
