* This customization is designed to work with a top, bottom, left & right aligned banner or normal guide layouts.
* The collapse action works by simply moving the guide inside the screen based on which ever location you choose i.e top, bottom, left or right edge of the screen, choose the code folder based on your preferences.
* You can use this to move the entire guide container out of the way (make sure the expand button is still visible), or you can leave the guide partially visible and hide the bottom section only.
* The collapsed state is saved in sessionStorage so that when users navigate between pages, the guide will stay collapsed or expanded.
