# Snooze & Go To A different Guide Using DynamiC Permalink

This will execute a snooze and a go to a different guide using a dynamic permalink to handle situations where the url keeps changing based on multiple factors.

Example URL >> https://<customer_name>.app.com/

You can add any kind of button you'd like, as the first lines of this code will use the existing event listener to use the snooze action as a trigger for further action.

You can use standard snooze options on the button setup.
