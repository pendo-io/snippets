* This code affects text polls only
* You can use it to limit the number of characters a visitor is allowed to input
* It also shows a counter for how many characters are remaining
* To implement the customization, add a custom code building block to your guide and add the JavaScript and HTML in their respective tabs within the code block
* Position the custom code block under the text area for best effect
* The code as-is will only affect the first text poll in a guide
* If you have more than one text poll in a guide you will need to modify the code accordingly
